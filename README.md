The goal of this repo is to make a Maze class to solve mazes using various algorithms.

By default the maze is a text file where 
  the walls are '#', 
  the start cell is 'A', 
  the end cell is 'B',
  the paths are ' ' and
  the solved paths are '*'

Solving methods present currently:
  1. Depth First Search
  2. Breadth First Search
  3. Greedy Best-First Search (_using Manhattan Distance_)
  4. A* Algorithm (_using Manhattan Distance and Cost acquired so far to get to current Cell_)
